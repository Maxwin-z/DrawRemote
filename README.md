# DrawRemote

## What is the purpose of DrawRemote?

When I teach my children programming, we stay together. I write code on my computer and cast it to the television, while they write code on their computers. However, two issues concern me. First, I want to draw or mark something on my screen to help them understand better. Second, I cannot see their screens. When they encounter a problem, I have to leave my seat to assist them. Therefore, I wanted to create a tool to solve these problems.

It must be simple to use, delightful, and focused on teaching. So, I created the app DrawRemote. It uses MultipeerConnectivity to connect all the local devices in one go. I can use my iPad to connect all the children’s MacBooks and mine. This way, I can draw on my iPad, and the drawing will display on the television. I can also see the children’s screens on my iPad and mark anything I need to. When they encounter a problem, I can help them immediately.
